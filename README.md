# JavaScript Calculator with Cypress Testing
## About
As a Nology consultant, I was advised that I should have something with testing in my software Portfolio. \
So I developed a simple (not so simple) old-skool Calculator App to demonstrate that I also cater for unit and end to end App testing. \
A fully working Calculator that also incorprates CYPRESS testing to validate its calculations. \
Built on JavaScript & SCSS, with the CYPRESS testing framework. \
